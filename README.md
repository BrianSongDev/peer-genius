# Peer Genius Web App
Made with ReactJS
### Files so far:
- Landing page
### To build:
**Here is a link to a more comprehensive set-up guide. Simply opening the HTML file will not activate the other files as they need to be compiled first.**
- Make sure you have git, npm, and parcel installed (npm install parcel-bundler)
- Clone the folder
- Go into Terminal
- ```cd FOLDERNAME```
- ```npm start```
- Go into the localhost URL the terminal window gives you.
