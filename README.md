# Peer Genius Web App

Made with ReactJS

### Files so far:

- Landing page
- Login page

### To build:

**Here is a link to a more comprehensive set-up guide. Simply opening the HTML file will not activate the other files as they need to be compiled first.** [Link](https://github.com/BrianSongDev/peer-genius/blob/master/setup.md)

- Make sure you have git, npm, and parcel installed (npm install parcel-bundler)
- Clone the folder
- Go into Terminal
- `cd FOLDERNAME`
- `npm start`
- Go into the localhost URL the terminal window gives you.
